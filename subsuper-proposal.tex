\abstract{Widespread Unicode support in programming languages now allows software developers in technical fields to use notations like Greek letters and sub/superscripts in their code that closely follow standard mathematical notations. This development has been hampered by the fact that only a subset of Latin and Greek characters have sub/superscript codepoints in Unicode 13, and so we propose to expand the set of sub/superscript characters to encompass common mathematical usage, ideally by simply adding two new combining characters.}


\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

Many recent programming languages (including C\#~\cite{Csharp}, Fortress~\cite{Fortress},
Go~\cite{Go}, Java~\cite{Java}, Julia~\cite{Julia}, Python~3~\cite{Python}, Scala\cite{Scala}, and Swift\cite{Swift}) allow
a broad range of Unicode characters to be employed by the programmer
for identifiers (names of functions and variables), and indeed such
behavior is recommended by the \emph{Unicode Standard Annex~\#31}~\cite{UAX31}.
For programmers working in mathematical fields, including statistics,
science, and engineering, where a wide array of mathematical notations
and symbols are commonplace, this often enables computer programs
to be written in a notation that closely mimics their standard mathematical
descriptions. For example, in a mathematical context one might easily
have a quantity with a name like $\hat{x}$ or $\alpha_{x}$, and
the same names can now be used in computer programs for this quantity
($\mathrm{\hat{{x}}}$ = U+0078 U+0302, $\mathrm{{\upalpha_{x}}}$
= U+03B1 U+2093) rather than ASCII approximations such as \texttt{xhat}
and \texttt{alpha\_x} that are used in older programming languages.
Furthermore, text-editing software is making it increasingly easy
for programmers to type such symbols by ``tab completion''
(e.g. typing ``$\mathrm{{\upalpha_{x}}}$''
as \texttt{\textbackslash{}alpha}\texttt{\emph{{[}tab{]}}}\texttt{\textbackslash{}\_x}\texttt{\emph{{[}tab{]}}})
or related techniques in several popular editors~\cite{vsCode,Atom,Emacs,Sublime,Vim}
and interactive programming environments~\cite{Julia,IPython}. This
is an important and positive trend. To quote a 2001 draft of \emph{Unicode
Technical Report~\#25}~\cite[section 5.3]{UTR25}, \emph{Using real
mathematical expressions in computer programs would be far superior
in terms of readability, reduced coding times, program maintenance,
and streamlined documentation.}

One notation that is extremely common throughout all of mathematics
is the use of subscripts and superscripts. Unfortunately, Unicode
13.0 provides only a very limited selection of subscript and superscript
characters (digits 0--9, parentheses, $+$/$-$/$=$, a subset of
the Latin and Greek alphabets, and a few phonetic symbols). Therefore,\textbf{
we propose that Unicode be extended to encode all the subscript/superscript
characters most commonly used in mathematical notation}: all lower-
and upper-case Latin and Greek letters (and variants thereof) and
a selection of other mathematical symbols described below. Because
these are all derived from existing Unicode codepoints, the assignment
of their properties and the development of their fonts will be straightforward.
As one possible implementation strategy, we suggest that the Consortium
\textbf{add two new ``mathematical subscript'' and ``mathematical
superscript'' combining characters} that convert the preceding character
(or character + combining characters) into a sub/superscript. (This is
closely related to the superscript and ``scientific
inferiors'' features already present in OpenType~\cite{OpenType}.)
Although the combining-character approach is potentially very general, it could
initially be suggested that the new combining characters may be ignored
except following a limited subset of characters commonly used in
mathematical notation (similar to how the emoji skin-tone modifiers only affect
rendering of a small set of emoji characters with skin-tone variants).

We should mention that there were past proposals to extend the range
of subscript and superscript characters in Unicode~\cite{L2-10-230,L2-11-208}
(neither of which mentioned mathematical or programming applications)
that were rejected. We have been unable to find an official record
of the grounds for rejection of these proposals, but there seem to
be two common objections in discussions of this topic on Unicode forums~\cite{Miller10,UCDF}.
First, that this is mere ``formatting''
devoid of semantic content, which is better accomplished via markup
languages like MathML or other typesetting technologies. Second, that
the set of characters that deserve sub/superscript variants is unclear
and might be subjected to never-ending extension. We believe that
both of those objections must be re-evaluated in light of mathematical
programming. First, subscripts and superscripts of any kind in mathematics
always have semantic content ($\mathrm{{\upalpha_{x}}}$ is very different
in meaning from $\mathrm{\upalpha\mathrm{{x}}}$). Second, \emph{programming
languages are almost invariably restricted to ``plain text''}---in
ordinary usage, computer code (and especially identifiers) cannot
be intermingled with MathML markup or other formatting codes---with
a few exceptions such as Mathematica~\cite{Mathematica} that are
edited and/or rendered mainly within specialized software). Third,
the restriction to
\emph{common mathematical notations} greatly limits the scope
of the additions, excluding the vast majority of Unicode characters
from consideration.

It is not practical to encode the full range of mathematical
notations in Unicode; MathML and similar will always be useful,
and generally should not be combined with Unicode-based formatting.
However, in programming contexts, where non-Unicode math formatting
is unavailable, increasing the set of available subscripts
and superscripts is a ``low-hanging fruit'' that would be tremendously
beneficial in technical fields. We respectfully urge you to expand the
set of mathematical subscripts and superscripts, and especially to
eliminate frustrating omissions from the Latin and Greek alphabets.


\section{Required Subscript/Superscript Characters}
\label{sec:required}

The following existing Unicode codepoints are widely used in subscripts and superscripts of mathematical notation, and should therefore have new sub/superscript variants (either as new codepoints or via combining characters as described below):

\begin{itemize}

\item Latin upper- and lower-case characters `a'--`z' (U+0061--007A) and `A'--`Z' (U+0041--005A).

\item Greek upper- and lower-case characters `$\upalpha$'--`$\upomega$' (U+03B1--03C9) and `A'--`$\Upomega$' (U+0391--03A9) as well as lunate epsilon `$\upepsilon$' (U+03F5).

\item Decimal digits `0'--`9'  (U+0030--0039): these already have acceptable sub/superscript characters (U+2080--2089 and U+2070--2079), which should be canonically equivalent to the corresponding digit followed by a sub/superscript combining character as described below.

\item Brackets: `(' and `)' (U+0028--0029),  `[ and `]' (U+005B and U+005D), `\{' and `\}' (U+007B and U+007D).   Of these, parentheses `()' already have acceptable sub/superscript characters (U+208D--208E and U+207D--207E), which should be canonically equivalent to the corresponding character followed by a sub/superscript combining character as described below.

\item Comma `,' (U+002C) and semicolon `;' (U+003B).

\item Common mathematical operators: `$+$` (U+002B), `$-$` (U+002D and U+2212), `$\pm$' (U+00B1), `$*$' (U+002A), `$\times$' (U+00D7), `/' (U+002F), `$=$' (U+003D), `$<$` (U+003C), `$>$' (U+003E).   Of these, `$+$', and `$-$', `$=$' already have acceptable sub/superscript characters (U+207A--207C and U+0208A--208C), which should be canonically equivalent to the corresponding character followed by a sub/superscript combining character as described below.

\item Other important mathematical symbols widely used in sub/superscript form: `$\Vert$'  (U+2016), `$\perp$' (U+27C2), `$\infty$' (U+221E), `$\dagger$' (U+2020), `$\angle$' (U+2220).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relationship to existing sub/superscript letters}

A subset of Latin and Greek letters already have sub/superscript variants in Unicode.  For example, `$^\mathrm{a}$' is U+1D43 and `$_\mathrm{a}$' is U+2090, while `$^\mathrm{A}$' is U+1D2C but there is no subscript `A' character.   However, these codepoints seem to have been added piecemeal into the Unicode standard for a variety of semantic meanings unrelated to their usage in mathematical notation (e.g. `$^\mathrm{a}$' is in the Latin-1 Supplement block, whereas `$^\mathrm{k}$' is in the Phonetic Extensions block).  (Accordingly, they are rendered with inconsistent baselines and kerning in many fonts.) Therefore we recommend that these existing characters \textbf{should not be canonically equivalent} to the proposed new mathematical sub/superscript characters (whether implemented by new codepoints or by combining characters).

\section{Proposed new combining characters}

We believe that the simplest and most flexible way to support mathematical subscripts and superscripts would be to \textbf{add two new combining characters}, ``MATHEMATICAL SUBSCRIPT'' and ``MATHEMATICAL SUPERSCRIPT,'' which would indicate that the \textbf{preceding grapheme} should form a sub/superscript, respectively.   As mentioned in \secref{summary}, text-rendering software might optionally display only a limited set of characters in sub/superscript form, following a recommended list such as the one in \secref{required}, implemented as variant characters (e.g. similar to emoji skin-tone variants).

Both of these characters could be put into the general category Mn (nonspacing marks). Placing them in the nonspacing marks category would automatically allow the sub/superscript combining characters to be used following any valid identifier character in programming languages implementing \emph{Unicode Standard Annex~\#31}~\cite{UAX31} or similar rules, since category Mn is included in the \texttt{ID\_Continue} lexical class of \emph{Annex~\#31}.

The new combining characters should have bidirectional class ``Other Neutrals (ON)'' and mirror class ``N'' similar to the emoji modifiers, with no upper/lowercase mapping, should be treated like other combining characters for line-breaking and collation, and should be allowed in identifiers as lexical class \texttt{ID\_Continue} as mentioned above.   Several  canonical equivalencies to existing sub/superscript characters are suggested in \secref{required}.

Some programming languages may further opt to allow additional sub/superscript mathematical symbols in identifiers on a case-by-case basis. For example, Julia~\cite{Julia} already allows sub/superscript parentheses in identifiers (e.g. $\upchi^{(3)}$ is a valid Julia identifier for a ``Kerr susceptibility'' in optics) so it might be natural in Julia to allow sub/superscript commas and asterisks (e.g. $\mathrm{p}^*$ or $\mathrm{p}_*$ may denote the ``primal optimum'' in convex-optimization problems).

\subsection{Alternative: Many new sub/superscript characters}

The alternative to adding new combining characters is to simply add new characters for the individual sub/superscripts proposed in \secref{required}, which would then be treated similarly to existing sub/superscript characters.  They would be placed in general category Lm (modifier letter) for Latin and Greek letters, Ps/Pe (open/close punctuation) for brackets, Po (other punctuation) for comma and semicolon, and Sm (math symbol) for mathematical symbols.   The disadvantages of this approach are obvious: many new codepoints must be chosen and documented, supporting additional mathematical sub/superscripts in the future will require additional revisions to the standard (as opposed to improvements in fonts or rendering software).

\section{Lack of Possible Equivalents}

As explained in \secref{required}, Unicode currently contains only a subset of the most common mathematical subscripts and superscripts, and omits many Latin and Greek letters (e.g. there is no superscript `q' or subscript `A').  Furthermore, markup languages like MathML, OpenDocument format (ODF), and similar typesetting/text-formatting technologies are not usable for representing code in programming languages, nearly all of which require ``plain text'' input with no XML or other formatting metadata.

\section{Provision of Fonts}
